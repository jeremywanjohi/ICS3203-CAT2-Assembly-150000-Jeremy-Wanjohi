; ===============================================
; Question 4 Notes
; ===============================================

; ### How the Program Determines Actions

; #### Sensor Input Reading:
; The program reads the sensor value from `SENSOR_PORT` using the `in` instruction.
; The value is stored in the `AL` register for processing.

; #### Threshold Comparisons:
; The sensor value in `AL` is compared against two predefined thresholds:

; - **High Threshold (80):**
;   If the sensor value is greater than or equal to 80, the program jumps to the `HIGH_LEVEL` label to execute actions.

; - **Moderate Threshold (50):**
;   If the value is between 50 and 79, the program jumps to the `MODERATE_LEVEL` label.

; - **Low Level (below 50):**
;   If the value is less than 50, the program executes the `LOW_LEVEL` logic.

; ### Actions Based on Sensor Input

; #### High Level (â‰¥ 80):
; - Turn on the motor by setting bit 0 in `MOTOR_PORT`.
; - Trigger the alarm by setting bit 0 in `ALARM_PORT`.

; #### Moderate Level (50-79):
; - Stop the motor by clearing bit 0 in `MOTOR_PORT`.

; #### Low Level (< 50):
; - Turn off the motor by clearing bit 0 in `MOTOR_PORT`.

; ### How Ports Are Manipulated

; The program uses memory-mapped I/O ports to control the motor and alarm.
; Specific bits in the ports are manipulated to reflect their state:

; #### Motor Control (`MOTOR_PORT`):
; - **Turn On the Motor:**
;   - Reads the current motor state using `in`.
;   - Sets bit 0 to `1` using the `or` operation.
;   - Writes the updated state back to `MOTOR_PORT`.

; - **Stop/Turn Off the Motor:**
;   - Reads the current motor state.
;   - Clears bit 0 using the `and` operation with the mask `0xFE`.
;   - Writes the updated state back to `MOTOR_PORT`.

; #### Alarm Control (`ALARM_PORT`):
; - **Trigger the Alarm:**
;   - Reads the current alarm state using `in`.
;   - Sets bit 0 to `1` using the `or` operation.
;   - Writes the updated state back to `ALARM_PORT`.

; ### Conclusion
; The program reads the sensor value from `SENSOR_PORT` and uses conditional jumps to determine the appropriate action based on the thresholds.
; It manipulates specific bits using bitwise operations to control the motor and the alarm, therefore allowing for precise control based on the sensor input.
